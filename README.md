To-do:
  - Backend:
    - [X] Add logging (replace all print stmts)
    - [X] Add find
    - [ ] Fix all the other endpoints that are broken
    - [ ] Standardize api responses and document
    - [ ] Figure out how to get lab class schedules + display "HAAS 257 has a class going on right now!" or something
    - [ ] Logging stats on people, so user x has spend y time in lab z, and rank people. We could make kickass charts for this as well
    - [ ] Move everything to a non-shitty web framework: flask/django.
    - [ ] Split out thread slave stuff into another file
    - [ ] Split out helper functions into another file (util.py or helper.py)
    - [ ] Make hostnames ordered within cluster within master/cluster api calls i.e. {escher: [{escher00}, {escher01}, ...] instead of random order
  - Frontend:
    - [ ] Filtering by tty/pts
    - [ ] Display traffic graph/heatmap (d3)
    - [ ] Rewrite using an actual framework (angular/react), look into react-native
